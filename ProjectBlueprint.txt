Program Classes:
Players
Goals
Map
Ball
UI
Sprite

Sprite:
-Pos(x,y)
-Surface - Some image
-Default Constructor
-void Draw() - blit's Surface onto brackground surface
-bool Collide() - Check's for collision with another sprite (per-pixel collision?) should output a boolean.

Players extends Sprite:
-float Speed - Set player speed

-int team - number incicates the color (could be implemented with another data type)

-void bool posession - Whether player has ball or not

-move() - Changes x and y values for the sprite on the screen (implementation involves Speed value of player)

-void throwBall() - Sends a ball at out a certain speed (probably involves blitting it on the background again 
	       and making the ball go a certain direction according to how the player is moving)  	

-void captureBall() - Method that takes in the bool value of collide() with ball and 
		 player and turns posession to true or false and blitting the bal surface on the player.  

Ball extend Sprite:
-speed - Set ball speed

-void move() - Similar to Player move()

Goal extends Sprite:
-int team
-int containBall - how full the goal is
-void addPoints() - adds points to goal

Boundary extends Sprite:
-upperB
-lowerB
-leftB
-rightB

Obstacles extends Sprite: 
-createBarrier()
-createFriction()

namespace Level:
-holds all arragnements of goals and obstacles

GameEngine:
-initializes()
-mainloop:
	-UI
	-Movement
